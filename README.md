This is the code for a simple reaction trainer I built using an Arduino nano, a cheapo ebay monochrome OLED display and some big ass buttons. My wife saw professional badminton players train with it in Thailand and wanted one for her badminton club so I built one for her. The enclosure and the button housings are designed by me and 3d-printed with a Makergear printer, some parts were PETG, others TPU for obvious reasons.
